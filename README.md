# 🕹️ Tetris AI Agents: Genetic Algorithm & Simulated Annealing

Welcome to the **Tetris AI Agents** project! This repository contains two intelligent agents designed to tackle the classic game of Tetris using **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Simulated Annealing (SA)**. These AI strategies aim to optimize gameplay by efficiently placing Tetriminos to maximize score and minimize game-over scenarios.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧬 **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Evolves a population of AI agents by applying selection, mutation, and crossover to enhance performance over generations.
- ❄️ **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: Uses a probabilistic approach to explore and exploit board states, optimizing moves dynamically.

## 🏗️ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Usage
Run the agents and watch them play Tetris:

```bash
python main.py gen  # Run Genetic Algorithm agent
python main.py sa  # Run Simulated Annealing agent
```

Made with ❤️ for AI and Tetris enthusiasts!
